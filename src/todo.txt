OLD 

create recentyDeleted
- inside firestore db as a collection
- as a react component


patients ()
- if patient is deleted, cascade delete down to its appointments (can we do this through firestore?)

appointments ()
- create an appointment field for each patient which takes in an array of appointment ids 


appt_form (7/25)
- currently stuck trying to get promise.all to work. Only returns an empty array not what db.send, etc should return. Db.send, etc works fine
outside of promise.all
- first display, full list of facilities while disabling providers field second, once a facility is selected enable the 
providers field and only display providers that are linked facility
- if new provider or facilty is entered (meaning an option from the drop suggestions is not selected), then edit the patient and
facility objects to include the new entries
            


appt_form (7/22)
- make facility and provider drop down fields when there are existing facilities and providers in the selected patient object
        UX: facilities and providers are a one-to-many relationship
            first display, full list of facilities while disabling providers field
            second, once a facility is selected enable the providers field and only display providers that are linked facility


ptnt_form (7/22)
- make a small version and export it so that it can be used in appointment form. When user wants to create new patient inside appt_form, only ask for
    first and last name
- how should patients fill in facility and provider field (regular form)? 
        * Facilities and providers have a one-to-many relationship
        * Idea for patient id view: have a field for facility, then a field for doctor (this is current set up), but also include the option to add more providers for that facility
        * For now, we are going to assume that patients and providers have a one-to-one relationship


appointment_form: 
- (done, fixed with error verification) fix the date and time so that it submits (currently does not work if time is empty, problem with joing the date and time)
- (done) add error verification (make sure date can't be empty)
- (done) add a "don't know time" checkbox
- (done) make sure to submit data with pid and patient as seperate keys
